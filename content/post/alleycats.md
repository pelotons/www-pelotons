The bike courier scene of the 70's and 80's is almost extinct but the underground punk culture has seen a revival with the resurgence of fixed gear bikes. In the height of the courier scene informal races were organised where couriers raced between locations in a city for bragging rights, usually ignoring any traffic laws and taking huge risks to get back first. Today underground Alleycats are organised on Instagram but commercial companies like RedBull are trying to hijack the scene.
