This website has been setup to publish short films and photo galleries of planned epic bike adventures. Some like the Tuscany Trail, Badlands and the French Divide are organized bikepacking and ultra-endurance racing events, others like Berlin to Auschwitz and The Bunker Project will be solo self organized projects.

I have never created a short film or photo gallery in my life so this is definitely going to be a steep learning experience but after countless hours watching YouTube travel vlogs like [Bald and Bankrupt](), [Indigo Traveller](), [Fernwee](), [Kraig Adams](), [Harry Dwyer](), [Itchy Boots](), [Shiey](), [Martijn Doolard](), [Beau Miles]() and [c90 Adventures]() and an avid reader and watcher of the excellent cycling travel blogs and vlogs at [bikepacking.com]() it's time to give it a go. 

There won't be any "morning Internet, welcome to the vlog" or "hit the subscribe button below, it really helps out the channel" nonsense and definitely no attempts at flowery creative writing alongside the photo galleries. The plan is for the film style to be five to ten minutes of non-narrated content, probably set to a soundtrack and likely published alongside an additional directors cut with commentary. Some like Berlin to Auschwitz will almost certainly be black & white.

So without further ado here is the bucket list of rides I would like to do with a summary of what they are all about and a link to click though to a page with more information about each one. So far the plan is to do two projects in 2022, The Tuscany Trail in May (spring) as a photo gallery and Berlin to Auschwitz in the fall (when its cold, dark, wet and miserable).   

## 2022

### The Tuscany Trail
Pitched as the worlds biggest bike packing event with 3,000 riders each year, the [Tuscany Trail]() the route changes each year but is generally around 600km and usually includes Sienna, Florence and a whole load of Strade Bianci. [Read More]()

### Berlin to Auschwitz
After living in the States for twenty years you realize the extent of the history in Europe including the modern history in the 20th century. I vividly remember the black and white cinematography of [Schindlers List]() and reading about a cyclist exploring the camp, this ride seems like a great first film. I will be following roughly 550km along the rail route the Nazi's used to deport Jews from Berlin to the killing camps at Auschwitz. [Read More]()

2023 is a long way out but I am hoping to do a project every three months with the following four at the top of my current list. 

## 2023

### The Japanese Odyssey 
I have been lucky to go to Tokyo a few times and love the Japanese culture. The [The Japanese Odyssey](https://www.japanese-odyssey.com/) is billed as a cycling adventure across Japan, deep into forests, small roads and generally off the beaten track. The route changes each year but is typically 2,000km to 2,500km with about 30,000m of climbing that must be completed passing 10 to 15 fixed checkpoints before a cut-off time that is usually around 10 days. [Read More]()

### French Divide
The [French Divide]() which changes a little each year is a 2,200km route with 35,000m of climbing. The route is 70% on gravel and farm tracks and 30% on roads going from Flanders in the North to the France Spain border in Basque country. It even passes though a small town close to where I lived near Toulouse. [Read More]()

### The Bunker Project
In 2019 I supported a kickstarter book called [The Rough Stuff Fellowship Archive]() that took a set of photographs and notes from a British cycling club called the Rough Stuff Fellowship that was started in 1956. Cyclist Magazine has a [good short article](https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/7010/blast-from-the-past-the-rough-stuff-fellowship) about their history. The author behind the project [Max Leonard](https://maxleonard.com/) went on to self publish another book called Bunker Research in which he and a photographer called [Camille McMillan](https://www.instagram.com/camillejmcmillan/) explored the WW2 bunkers across the Alps, many in very remote locations. I always thought it would be a great project to film rides to the bunkers, eventually trying to get to them all. [Read More]()

### Badlands
