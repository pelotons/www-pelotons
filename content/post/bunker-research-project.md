An ongoing series of short-films riding to the World War II bunkers in the Alps, explored in the 1960's by the [Rough Stuff Fellowship](https://www.rsf.org.uk/about-us/history-and-beginnings.html) and documented on the [Bunker Research](https://bunkerresearch.com/) site and [accompanying book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bunker-Research-history-modernism-mountains/dp/0995488649).
<!--more-->

The plan is to ride to each bunker or a series of bunkers documenting the route, terrain and the bunker with hopefully some history of the role the bunker played in the war.

## Starting Spring 2023
